# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repository. Keep it in sync with the code: update it whenever architecture, persistence,
interfaces or major data flow change.

## What Mattiverse is

A launcher (iOS/Android look, one app open at a time) that **installs, updates and backs up Docker apps**. It is a thin layer on top of
three **engines** that own the configuration and show it in their own UI: **MatDock** (stacks, backups, schedules), **Matcad** (routes,
certificates, DNS providers) and **Matddns** (IP sources, DNS records, rules), plus the optional single sign-on **MatIdentity**, which Mattiverse installs and wires (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "MatIdentity"). Mattiverse calls their REST APIs (`docs/ENGINES.md`); the wizard
installs them and asks once for the domain and the DNS account. They are fixed parts, not options. Every app is a compose project.

Stack: ASP.NET Core on **.NET 10**, C#, **Razor Pages** + TagHelper controls, EF Core + **SQLite**, the `docker` CLI against the mounted
socket, plain JavaScript (no build step), Docker-first. Web port **8030**.

The look and the controls are **MatUi**, the toolkit of [MatDesign](https://github.com/Real-TTX/MatDesign) (the design and identity of all Mat apps, port 8060): the pages are built from its classes and follow its rulebook. Look there (the Components page, the Shell page, the rules) before building any UI.

Read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing the design: it records the decisions (the engines own the
configuration, reading goes to Docker and changes to the engines, catalog as data, ...). [docs/ENGINES.md](docs/ENGINES.md) is the API contract
with MatDock, Matcad and Matddns, [docs/CATALOG.md](docs/CATALOG.md) the format of a catalog entry,
[docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md) the state of the sibling repositories (the `mattiverse-integration` branches).

## Build / run / test

- **Build:** `dotnet build Mattiverse.slnx` (note: `.slnx`). SDK 10 (see `global.json`). Expected: 0 warnings.
- **Unit tests:** `dotnet test` (xunit; no Docker needed: catalog parsing, generated compose files, variables, ports, schedules,
  `docker ps` parsing, and `WebUiTests`: the pages name only icons of the toolkit sprite, have no inline style or script, and the stylesheet has tokens only).
- **Browser checks:** `cd tests/e2e && npm install && node run.js [http://localhost:8030]` (Playwright, installed Edge) against the running dev stack: every page light, dark and on a phone,
  the theme button, the list tools, validation, the flash message, the wizard, the drawer. It removes what it creates.
- **Run / test the app: always rebuild the container and redeploy the stack** (project rule): `./scripts/redeploy.ps1`
  (`-Fresh` wipes the volume, `-Port` changes the host port). Dev stack: `docker-compose.dev.yml` (app + `sqlite-web` on 8021).
  In `Development` the account `tester` / `Tester123!` exists.
- **Release stack:** `docker-compose.yml`, image `ghcr.io/real-ttx/mattiverse`, one service and one volume: keep it that simple.
- **Real tests are end-to-end against Docker.** The pattern that worked: install apps through the UI with Playwright
  (installed Edge, see the `screenshots` skill), then check with `docker ps` / `docker exec` / `curl`. Remember
  `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` for Git Bash arguments that start with `/`.
- **The development PC has all Docker address pools used up** (`all predefined address pools have been fully subnetted`).
  To test installs there, put an explicit `networks: default: ipam: config: - subnet: 10.253.x.0/24` into the catalog copy
  under `/data/catalog` and give each app its own subnet, and set `Mattiverse__NetworkSubnet` for the shared network. The web port is 8030
  (8020 is Schulio's); `MATTIVERSE_PORT` changes the host port.
- **Testing the engines:** run a second Mattiverse (`docker run`, own volume, port 8130) with catalog copies in `/data/catalog` that use the locally built
  images (`matdock:mattiverse`, `matcad:mattiverse`, `matddns:mattiverse`, built from the `mattiverse-integration` branches), `pull_policy: never`
  (compose cannot pull a local image), other host ports (the PC has a real MatDock on 4455, Matcad on 4433) and own subnets. Do not touch the
  other containers on the PC.
- **Updating the toolkit:** `./scripts/update-matui.ps1` copies `matui.css`, `matui.js`, `matui.boot.js` and `matui-icons.svg` from a running MatDesign (default http://localhost:8060) into
  `wwwroot/matui`. The files are a copy (rule CODE-03): never edit them here, a change belongs into MatDesign. The version is the first line of `matui.css`.
- **Changing engine behaviour:** the engines' own repositories are where it happens (branch `mattiverse-integration`); keep `docs/ENGINES.md` and the
  clients (`MatDockClient`, `MatcadClient`, `MatddnsClient`) in step with them.

## Conventions

**Code**
- Microsoft C# guidelines, file-scoped namespaces, `.editorconfig`. Few nested types; several business functions per class are fine.
- Long Docker work never runs in a request: queue a `Job` (`AppJobs.*`) and let the pages poll `/api/jobs/<id>/log`.
- **Read from Docker, change through the engines.** Status, containers and logs come from `docker` (labels); installs, updates, backups, routes and
  DNS records go through the engine's API with `managedBy: mattiverse`. Never write to an engine without that marker; never delete what Mattiverse did not create.
- Engine clients share the request's `DbContext` (the locator reads the app): never call two of them in parallel.
- Anything that parses CLI output has a unit test (a stopped container has an empty last field: never `Trim` such lines).
- Generated files use LF. A single quote must not appear in variable values (they are written single-quoted to `.env`).

**Database**
- JSON for configuration (`config/system.json`), SQLite for logic. Tables are PascalCase and singular; the key is `Id` (64 bit);
  rows have `CreateDate`, `CreateUserId`, `UpdateDate`, `UpdateUserId`, `UpdateState` (0 deleted, 1 created, 2 updated);
  security keys are a `Token` UUID (`UserSession`, `ShareLink`). New schema: `dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/Mattiverse.Core
  --startup-project src/Mattiverse.Web --output-dir Data/Migrations`.

**UI** (the rules are MatDesign's: the rulebook and the Components page; where this list and the rulebook differ, the rulebook wins)
- A page is built only from the classes of the toolkit (`mat-*`); what only Mattiverse has is `mv-*` in `wwwroot/css/mattiverse.css` (tokens only, no literal colour).
  **No inline style, no inline script, no event-handler attribute** (`WebUiTests` checks).
- CRUD = a list plus a separate page for create/edit. A list: the toolbar on top (`<partial name="_Toolbar" />`: a search field, Filter and Sort as dialogs; the page model builds it from `ToolbarModel`
  and `ListView`; the query is `q`, the filters by name, `sort`, `dir` and `page`), the table (`mat-table`, a `data-label` on every cell, a status as `mat-pill`), `_Pager` directly under it, the actions below
  (`mat-actions`, left-aligned). An empty list says so (`mat-empty`) and offers the action that fills it.
- A form: `<form class="mat-form" novalidate>`, `_ValidationSummary` on top, fields as `<mat-field>`, then `mat-btn-row`: Save, Back, (space) Delete. The browser-side messages come from `data-msg-*`, the server's
  land in the same line. A save redirects and sets `StatusMessage` (TempData): the layout shows it as a toast, or as an alert when `IsError`. Confirmations are `data-confirm`. Dependent fields: `data-show-if`.
- The menu is `Navigation.For` (two menus for an administrator, one for a user; Settings is a submenu; a badge counts what runs). A page sets `Title`, `PageSub`, `Crumbs` and, where needed, `Width`, `OwnHead`
  or `Flush` (an app in a frame). Pages without a menu (sign-in, setup, a shared link, errors) use `_Bare`.
- **The logo is the planet with its orbit (`img/logo.svg`), on purpose:** the owner prefers it to the flat glyph tile that rule IDENT-03 asks for. Do not replace it without asking.
- The theme: the toolkit's button cycles System / Light / Dark and posts the choice to `/api/theme`; the account keeps it. Account, logout and the theme are at the bottom of the menu.
- Mobile matters: check phone width (390 px) for every new page; secondary table columns get `mat-hide-sm`.
- After a change to a CSS/cshtml file the container must be rebuilt (they are baked into the image).
- Take screenshots of real data only; never real user data in `docs/images`. The pictures of the README come from a second Mattiverse (own volume, port 8130, own subnets) with two apps installed
  through the UI; remove it afterwards.

**Git**
- Commit and push **under the user's name**, never add a Claude/Anthropic co-author trailer or "generated with" line.
- Branches: `main` = release, `dev` = development. Versions: release `<major>.<minor>.<build>-<date>`, development
  `nightly-<build>-<date>`, local `local-<date>` (`Directory.Build.props`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`).
